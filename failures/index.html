        <h3>2021</h3>
        
        <li class="statement">Got some criticism on my project at work from someone I look up to. I took that criticism pretty badly, and for the rest of the meeting I was unable to say anything else because I could not stop thinking about it. After reflecting, I realized this criticism wasn&#39;t targeted at me, but rather the project I was working on. One thing to always remember: You Are Not The Code You Write.</li>

        <h3>September 2020</h3>
        
        <li class="statement">I got a C in a Environmental Microbiology. I really hated the course content, and on the last day of the drop deadline, there was one seat left in STAT 251 (that I should of taken), but I stayed enrolled in Environmental Microbiology. If you don&#39;t enjoy a course, don&#39;t feel bad for dropping it. Your time and money is valuable.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li class="statement">Failed an Organic Chemistry quiz. This one hits hard because I was planning to major in Chemistry, and it was my favorite course in high school. Since I took Chemistry HL as an IB student, I was able to skip first year chemistry, which meant I was quite rusty when I took CHEM 233, more than a year after my IB exams. For the future, I&#39;ll make to revisit my foundations!</li>
