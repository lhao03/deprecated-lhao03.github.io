    <p>As a computer science student minoring in biochemistry, you can expect me to have taken a wide range of courses from data structures and algorithms to environmental microbiology. So I thought, hey let&rsquo;s review some courses!</p>
<h2 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h2>
<h3 id="cpsc-110-">CPSC 110 üêÑ</h3>
<p>At UBC this is one of the first computer science courses you need to take to be admitted into the computer science major. Personally, I think it is one of the hardest and most eye opening computer science courses I&rsquo;ve ever taken. Firstly, the course uses Racket, a programming language based on Lisp. Then you&rsquo;re taught to use design recipes. And then finally, you must trust the natural recursion. This course actually really helped me learn how to plan out solutions to Leetcode questions and understand concepts in CPSC 221. And of course, Gregor makes sure you eat, sleep and breath recursion üêÑ.</p>
<h3 id="cpsc-121">CPSC 121</h3>
<p>This course is the second required course you need to take to apply to the computer science major at UBC. At its core, CPSC 121 is an introductory proofs and logic course with circuits thrown in for good measure. Unlike calculus, most high school students have never been exposed to the content in 121. I usually never use office hours, but for this course I did! The assignments can be challenging, but it also feels really good to churn out a proof by induction. My advice is to keep on top of your textbook readings and use those office hours!</p>
<h3 id="cpsc-210">CPSC 210</h3>
<p>I found this course one of the easiest computer science courses I&rsquo;ve taken so far. This course is all about Java, OOP and design patterns! This is also the first course that has a large project associated with it. The project requirements aren&rsquo;t that hard, but anything becomes hard if you don&rsquo;t have enough time to do it. This course uses the same video platform that CPSC 110 did. I really liked drawing out relationships between classes, objects and methods to understand what was going on. I&rsquo;m also currently a teaching assistant for this course, so hit me up if you are in this course and need help.</p>
<h3 id="cpsc-221">CPSC 221</h3>
<p>This course is pretty much your standard data structures and algorithms courses. As someone who is not very good with this stuff, I definitely found this course difficult at times (not to mention, it&rsquo;s taught in C++). I don&rsquo;t really have much else to say other then always remember to deallocate your pointers when you are done using them. Wait, what&rsquo;s a pointer again&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h2>
<h3 id="math-100">MATH 100</h3>
<p>Just your basic first year university differential calculus course. But this course is nothing like high school calculus. Just because you got 100 in high school calculus does not mean you can ace this course. Always attend lecture, do textbook questions and attend office hours. Unfortunately I never attended office hours and MATH 100 is one of my lowest marks.</p>
<h3 id="math-101">MATH 101</h3>
<p>Just your basic first year integral calculus course. Same as for MATH 100 ^^^.</p>
<h3 id="stat-251">STAT 251</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much to say about this course. It&rsquo;s a pretty standard statistics course which teaches you about all the different types of distributions, conditional probability and more. Make sure you&rsquo;re caught up on the textbook readings and questions and you won&rsquo;t have too much trouble with this course.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chemistry">Chemistry</h2>
<h3 id="chem-123-130">CHEM 123 (130)</h3>
<p>If you have taken chemistry IB HL, this course will be a breeze for you. I took this course during the summer of covid 19. This course comes with a course note book which is VERY USEFUL. I still use that course note book in my other chem and bio courses.</p>
<h3 id="chem-233">CHEM 233</h3>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m not a chemistry major üò≠, this was the only organic chemistry course I was able to register for. I attended Jay&rsquo;s lectures, even though I wasn&rsquo;t registered for his class. Sadly, Jay will not be able to make any more T***p jokes. Lots and lots and lots of reaction pathways. Cheatsheets are your friend in this course. Also don&rsquo;t rely on your cheatsheets, they should only be used to confirm what you know. You should have nearly all the reaction pathways memorized. (I&rsquo;m not sure if you will be allowed cheetsheets in person, so just memorize the pathways). Make sure to stay on top of problem sets and attend the office hours.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>
<h3 id="biol-112">BIOL 112</h3>
<p>I took this introductory biology course in the summer of Covid 19. Having not taken Biology 30, I found this course pretty manageable. If you remember grade 12 biology you will be set.</p>
<h3 id="biol-200">BIOL 200</h3>
<p>This course helped me really appreciate the biology of our body!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="microbiology">Microbiology</h2>
<h3 id="micb-201">MICB 201</h3>
<p>I have strong words to say about this course. The content is really interesting for sure, but the way this course was delivered during the pandemic made it really hard for me to learn the content.</p>
<p>Some people think prerecorded lectures are the holy grail. Unfortunately, prerecorded lectures are a huge hassle for me. A one hour recorded lectures always turns into a three hour lecture for me. Additionally, we were given 20 page readings per week and we had 6ish quizzes making up our entire mark (which I failed at least one). Quiz and final questions were ambiguous and very unforgiving. This course was essentially converted into distance learning, which I&rsquo;ve had a horrible experience with in the past.</p>
<h3 id="micb-202">MICB 202</h3>
<p>One of the most interesting courses I&rsquo;ve taken at UBC. The instructors were so forgiving during the pandemic and they worked hard to create unique and fun assignments. We learned about the immune system, viruses and bacterial diseases, which is pretty fitting for right now. The instructors were also knowledgeable about their topics at hand and I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in their immune system and viruses.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>
<h3 id="atsc-113">ATSC 113</h3>
<p>Easy booster but if you don&rsquo;t enjoy memorizing sentence after sentence after sentence, then this course will be a bore for you. I hated this course so much by the end. The easy booster mark was not worth the boredom and money.</p>
<h3 id="dsci-100">DSCI 100</h3>
<p>I highly recommend this course if you are someone from a non-coding background interested in data science. The instructors worked on creating their own textbook and interactive labs. This course is in R, which is commonly used in data science. There is also a final project associated with this course.</p>
